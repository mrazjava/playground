# Github Playground
A dummy project I use to test new github features as they are added. For example, I play around 
here when I experiment with github actions, webhooks, and generally features that interact with 
pushes to a repo.

The sources in this repo for all practical purposes are irrelevant. I started with a stock boot 
project via [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/), just so there is something to use for 
a build pipeline.
